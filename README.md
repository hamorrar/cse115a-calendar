I found the spreadsheet in class to be hard to follow. So I made this quick site to make the information easier to read.

### index.md
List out the assignment description, due date, where to find, and where to submit it.

### notes.md
If you have any notes from lecture, things you keep track of, a summary of Agile/Scrum or the tools used, feel free to put them here.
